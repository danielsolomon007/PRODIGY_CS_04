This little script uses the pynput library to watch what keys you press on your keyboard. 
Whenever you hit a key, it prints it out and tries to save it to a file called keylog.txt.
If it’s a normal letter or number, it writes it down — if it’s a special key like Shift or Ctrl, it just skips it and prints an error message instead. 
The script keeps running until you stop it yourself. 

dangerous tool so use it ethically :)
